# Quizzer

This is a little sample project, consisting of two main parts:
1. Quizzer.Console - A console trivia quiz application
2. Quizzer.TriviaServer - A web application that can be used to create questions.

The console application by default will use the [OpenTrivia Database](https://opentdb.com/), but can be configured to use our API compatible web application instead.
